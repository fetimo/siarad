## Overview

This is an **in-progress** Minecraft Fabric mod for 1.21+ to aid moderators of servers to see chat messages in separate
windows in-game. It also prevents accidental use of commands. It is a complete re-write of the chat interface
using [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib). The aim is to be similar
to [AdvancedChat](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/AdvancedChatCore), but more opinionated.
